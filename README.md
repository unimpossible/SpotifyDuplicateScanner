=======
Spotify Duplicate Scanner
=========================

- A program which is designed to run in the background deleting duplicates as you add them to playlists.
- Compiled with VC 2012 for Windows
- Not a ton of work has gone into this, especially the GUI so far
- The libspotify-plus-plus is a slightly modified version of https://code.google.com/p/libspotify-plusplus/

- You will need the Spotify API and an API key which you need to fill into keys.cpp
- You will need Boost
